                    love. Malia looked up at the blue sky. It was a beautiful
                    day and if her heart wasn’t feeling untenanted, she’d

                    The pain depression brings and the feeling of loneliness is
                    that it’s just you. Your world could be falling apart and
                    people could think you’re cold and withdrawn. But all you

                    they can be a complete nightmare. Dreams are usually an
